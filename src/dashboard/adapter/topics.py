"""
Centralized Topic Definitions

This module provides a single source of truth for all message broker topics
used throughout the application. This prevents typos, makes refactoring easier,
and provides better organization.

Usage:
    from modules.shared.v1.topics import SystemTopics, RobotTopics
    
    # Subscribe to system state updates
    broker.subscribe(SystemTopics.APPLICATION_STATE, callback)
    
    # Publish robot service state
    broker.publish(RobotTopics.SERVICE_STATE, state)
